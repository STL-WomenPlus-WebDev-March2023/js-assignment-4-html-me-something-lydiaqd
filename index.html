         <p class="funParagraph">My grandma's dog Lola is 13 years old. She is a dachsund with floppy ears, grey and white fur, and blue eyes. She has trouble seeing and hearing and her tongue hangs out of her mouth. Even though she has trouble hearing, she can always tell when food is being made in the kitchen.</p>

        <p class="funParagraph">This is my cat Alley. She is named Alley because my dad found her in an alley next to our house. She is 13 years old but she is still small like a kitten. She can do tricks like sit, spin, and sit-up.</p>
